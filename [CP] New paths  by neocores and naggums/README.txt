Stone and crystal flooring based on stone flooring from eemie's new paths: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/607
Lined dirt path based on CNCooper's garden paths: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1112

DEFAULT: Both wooden and vintage floorings are dark, with the void floor replacing the wooden path.

HOW TO INSTALL THE OTHER OPTIONS:

go into the 'options' folder, decide if you want it with or without the void pathing, and then decide which wooden floorings you want dark and/or cream. copy the appropriate 'flooring.png' from the folder, and then paste it inside the 'assets' folder , and say yes to over write.

alternatively: i have included the psd with all of the floorings seperated out, so that you can move them around and change the colors however you like!
